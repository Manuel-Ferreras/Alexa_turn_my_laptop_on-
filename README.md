# Alexa_turn_my_laptop_on-

I encountered daily inconvenience when I had to undock my laptop from its docking station in order to turn it on, as this required disconnecting my wired camera, keyboard, HDMI, and mouse. To address this issue, I sought out a solution to turn on my laptop without having to undock it.
 
So I use Amazon Alexa and wake up on Lan to turn Alexa with my voice.

- The process started  by turning wake on Lan in my laptop bios 
- Downloading the Wake on Lan (WOL) app in my Alexa porta 
- Create an account with the name of the device (also the name of what you say to turn on the device).
- Specific your mac address in the app.
- Create a new device in your Alexa portal and click find my device.
